This is a work done from my class CMSC430 at the University of Maryland. This class was focused on trying to rebuild the racket compiler using racket and a86 assembly code.
The parts I made include case, cond, abs, -, and not found in compile.rkt, compile-ops.rkt, interp.rkt, and interp-prim.rkt. The rest of the code was given to me for the
class. I was expected to understand all of the contents inside the listed files above, even for the things I did not write.
